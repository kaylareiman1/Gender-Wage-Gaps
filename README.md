# Gender Wage Gap: R Project
I created this R Markdown file as a final project for a CMU course called R for Analytics in Fall 2019. For this project, I used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to investigate the research question: is there a significant difference in income between men and women? This file contains the following components:

1. Data cleaning
2. Bivariate analysis of income based and gender
3. Analysis of other demographic characteristics such as race and teenage poverty and their relationship to both income and the gender-income gap
3. A linear regression, accompanied by sensitivity tests
4. Diagnostic plots
5. A discussion
